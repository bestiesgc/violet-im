[Violet](https://violet.besties.house) is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client made with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). It's focused on being intuitive on both desktop (through a browser) and mobile (as a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)). It's a work in progress under active development, so expect bugs!
